This script creates a small dictionary of Refugees in 5 countries and iterates it to create basic outputs. 

- This scirpt defines three functions. One function that prints out just the names of the countries chosen, one that prints out just the populations, and another that reads it out with a statement. 
- I encountered no issues with my code.
